# testing/php/bin

This directory contains important files needed by SM/PAN to run PHP unit tests. **DO NOT ALTER OR USE** this directory. Files here will be reset or deleted on updates to SM/PAN.

You can create a setup file (`testing/php/setup.php`) if you need to run some code before unit tests are performed.
