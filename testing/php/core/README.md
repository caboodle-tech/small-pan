# testing/php/core

This directory contains core unit tests for SM/PAN. **DO NOT ALTER OR USE** this directory. Files here will be reset or deleted on updates to SM/PAN.

You can create a setup file (`testing/php/setup.php`) if you need to run some code before unit tests are performed. You should create a new directory at `testing/php` to store your own unit tests following the pattern found in this directory.
